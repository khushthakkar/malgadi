// Hello My name is khushi and i have made a very simple webpage for the malgadi recruitment at my college. 
This is a simple webpage with very less graphics as i am more into interlinked webpages (i.e including buttons which takes u to another page and so on)
Also i have a good hand in back end. The contact us page i have included is fully functional which i made using java scrip. anyone who enters any thing in the contact us form is sent and stored on my personal email id. 
I usually freelance as a webdeveloper. Recently i made a webpage for Apurva acids and chemicals and gonna be published soon as soon as we have a domain. 
In this website i made for Malgadi Recruitment has alot of buttons to book flights and hotels and buses all at one place. Ultimately the webpage takes u to the official website of airindia or gsrtc acc to ur requirment. bcz at this stage collecting all the hotel and flight details is kinda impossible. 
with my freelance order and stuff it was tough to make this webpage and i made it in just an hour but if i had more time i could include a fully functioning bar to tract ur train ot flight when u enter ur reservation number.
